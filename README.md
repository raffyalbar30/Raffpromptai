Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJs] - react js component
- [Tailwindcss] - Styling component
- [Vscode] - my code editor



And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [React js](https://react.dev/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd Raffpromptai
pnpm install
pnpm run dev 
```

For production environments...

```sh
 //your api
 VITE_PROMPTAI = your api from groq AI
 //my api
 VITE_PROMPTAI = 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
```
